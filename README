This is the template mechanism I used for Draco Concordans, my annotation
website for _The Dragon Waiting_ (John M. Ford): http://eblong.com/draconc/

It is creaky, overspecialized code -- but on the other hand, it's
completely undocumented! I'm afraid I can't help you with any of it. I
really don't remember how it works myself. A more sensible move would
be to take a standard Python templating library and build this system
from scratch.


* Quick overview:

To run:

    python annotate.py

The ./output directory will be filled in with the generated HTML output.

The ./lib directory contains the template files.

- *.zml: HTML templates.
- all.css: Stylesheet (copied verbatim to ./output).
- chapters: A list of chapters, the page number each starts at, and the
  chapter title.
- topics: A list of letters at which to divide the alphabet. (The first
  must be A.) In the example, we'll have topic pages A-E, F-K, L-Q, R-Z.
- trytopics: A list of topics to mention under "Want to jump in?" on
  the front page.
- frames: Identifiers and names for special quote-boxes. The examples
  "md" and "eng" correspond with the stylesheet entries "FrameMD" and
  "FrameENG".

The ./lib/src directory contains topics and page references, one per
file. These are written in a crude markup language which is, like the
rest of this system, not documented.
